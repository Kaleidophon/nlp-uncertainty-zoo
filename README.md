### Included models

The following models are implemented in the repository. They can all be imported by using `from nlp-uncertainty-zoo import <MODEL>`.
For transformer-based model, furthermore a version of a model is available that uses a pre-trained BERT from the HuggingFace `transformers`.

### Usage

Each model comes in two versions, for instance `LSTMEnsemble` and `LSTMEnsembleModule`. The first one is supposed to be 
used as an out-of-the-box solution, encapsulating all training logic and convenience functions. These include fitting 
the model, prediction, getting the uncertainty for an input batch using a specific metric.

```python
model = LSTMEnsemble(**network_params, ensemble_size=10, is_sequence_classifer=False)
model.fit(train_split=train_dataloader)
model.get_logits(X)
model.get_predictions(X)
model.get_sequence_representation(X)
model.available_uncertainty_metrics
model.get_uncertainty(X)
model.get_uncertainty(X, metric_name="mutual_information")
```

In comparison, the `-Module` class is supposed to me more simple and bare-bones, only containing the core model logic. 
It is intended for research purposes, and for others who would like to embed the model into their own code base. While 
the model class (e.g. `LSTMEnsemble`) inherits from `Model` and would require to implement certain methods, any `Module` class
sticks closely to `torch.nn.Module`.

To check what arguments are required to initialize and use different models, check [the documentation here](http://nlpuncertaintyzoo.dennisulmer.eu/).

### Repository structure

The repository has the following structure:

* `models`: All model implementations.
* `tests`: Unit tests. So far, only contains rudimentary tests to check that all output shapes are consistent between models and functions.
* `utils`: Utility code (see below)
    * `utils/custom_types.py`: Custom types used in the repository for type annotations.
    * `utils/data.py`: Module containing data collators, and data builders - which build the dataloaders for a type of task and a specific dataset. Currently, language modelling, sequence labeling and sequence classification are supported.
    * `utils/metrics.py`: Implementations of uncertainty metrics.
    * `utils/samplers.py`: Dataset subsamplers for language modelling, sequence labelling and sequence classification.
    * `utils/task_eval.py`: Functions used to evaluate task performance.
    * `utils/uncertainty_eval.py`: Function used to evaluate uncertainty quality.
    * `utils/calibration_eval.py`: Function used to evaluate calibration quality.
* `config.py`: Define available datasets, model and tasks.
* `defaults.py`: Define default config parameters for sequence classification and language modelling (**Note**: These might not be very good parameters).

### Other features

* **Weights & Biases integration**: You can track your experiments easily with weights & biases by passing a `wandb_run` argument to `model.fit()`!
* **Easy fine-tuning via HuggingFace**: You can fine-tune arbitrary BERT models using their name from HuggingFace's `transformers`.

### Contributing

This repository is by no means perfect nor complete. If you find any bugs, please report them using the issue template,
and, if you also happen to provide a fix, create a pull request! A GitHub template is provided for that as well.

You would like to make a new addition to the repository? Follow the steps below:

* **Adding a new model**: To add a new model, add a new module in the `models` directory. You will also need to implement
a corresponding `Model` and `Module` class, inheriting from the classes of the same name in `models/model.py` and implementing all 
  required functions. `Model` is supposed to be an out-of-the-box solution that you can start experimenting right away, whil 
  `Module` should only include the most basic model logic in order to be easy to integrate into other codebases and allow tinkering.
  
* **Adding a new uncertainty metric**: To add a new uncertainty metric, add the function to `utils/metrics.py`. The function should take
the logits of a model and output an uncertainty score (the higher the score, the more uncertain the model). The function should output 
  a batch_size x sequence_length matrix, with batch_size x 1 for sequence classification tasks. After finishing the implementation, you can 
  add the metric to the `single_prediction_uncertainty_metrics` of the `models.model.Model` class and `multi_prediction_uncertainty_metrics` of `models.model.MultiPredictionMixin` (if applicable).
